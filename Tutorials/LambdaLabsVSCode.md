# Running VS Code Remotely on Lambda Labs (Mac-Friendly Guide)

Hereâ€™s how to set up VS Code to run files remotely on a Lambda Labs GPU instance. This guide includes steps for seamless integration, uploading files, and keeping your environment consistent.

### Step 1: Create and Set Up a Lambda Labs GPU Instance
1. Follow the [Getting Started with Lambda Cloud GPU Instances](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/getting-started-with-lambda-cloud-gpu-instances) tutorial to create your instance and configure SSH access.
2. Download your SSH key file (`FirstnameLastname.pem`) as instructed in the tutorial. For Mac users, place it in the `~/.ssh` directory and update permissions:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/FirstnameLastname.pem ~/.ssh/
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/FirstnameLastname.pem
   ```

### Step 2: Install Remote-SSH Extension in VS Code
1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions** view (press `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
3. Search for **Remote - SSH** and install it to enable remote connections from within VS Code.

### Step 3: Connect to the Lambda Instance
1. Open a terminal in VS Code.
2. Use the following SSH command to connect, replacing `FirstnameLastname.pem` with your key and `instance-ip-address` with your Lambda instance IP:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/FirstnameLastname.pem ubuntu@instance-ip-address
   ```
3. Once connected, VS Code will prompt you to open folders on your Lambda instance, giving you access to your project files directly.

### Step 4: Upload Files to the Lambda Instance
There are two main ways to upload files to the instance:
1. **Drag and Drop**: In the VS Code **Explorer** panel, you can drag files from your Mac into any open folder on the remote Lambda instance. For example, drag in a Jupyter notebook to start using it remotely.
2. **Git Workflow**: Alternatively, push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub), and then clone it each time you connect:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   ```

### Step 5: Manage Packages Efficiently in Jupyter
To avoid re-installing packages every session, add installation commands as cells in your Jupyter notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```
This way, your environment stays consistent, and you save time by managing dependencies directly within the notebook.

Now you're set up to work remotely on Lambda Labs with VS Code, right from your Mac. Happy coding!
